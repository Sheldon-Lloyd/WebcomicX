<h3 class="heading" id="about">About WebcomicX</h3>
<div class="content">
    <h4>What<h4/>
    <p>WebcomicX is a free open source content management system (CMS) made
    specifically for publishing your webcomics online. It’s lightweight with
    only the bare minimum feature need for maintaining your comic.</p>

    <h4>Why</h4>    
    <p>There are plenty Linux particularly PHP and MySQL based content management systems for webcomics. But none made for a windows server nor could I find one that didn’t require a database. Not having a database means that it is easier to set up--it will work right of the box it’s also potentially cheaper to maintain since you don't have to pay for a separate database.</p>

    <h4>Features</h4>
    <p>Since WebcomicX is a CMS designed for webcomics you can be sure each and
    every feature is there to make your webcomic better. Core features
    include:</p>

            plugins and add widgets. Add your own pages if the theme you’re
            using doesn’t have the webpage you need</p>
